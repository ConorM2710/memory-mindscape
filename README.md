# Memory Mindscape

Memory Mindscape utilises Javascript to allow the user to participate in a fun and interactive memory game. The site is targeted at people who want to test themselves mentally.

The site has been designed to look and feel "retro", this effect was achiveved by using pixelated font and a black and green color scheme much like the old green phosphorus monochrome computer screens.
